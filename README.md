# Procedural-Caves
 Procedural caves using cellular automata with simple rules to define cave-like shapes over a defined amount of iterations. Based off Conway's Game of Life board and cell structures. Made using Windows Form App in .NET6, only functional on Windows systems.

 Rule 1: Any wall cell with less than the designated (default 3) number of adjacent walls becomes a floor
 Rule 2: Any floor cell with more than the designated (default 4) number of adjacent walls becomes a wall
